This website was me very first one so I wanted to use it to describe who I am and just the king of person I am. It contains 5 pages that show each of my favorite things. All of them was created usig HTML coding that I did and learned. It is being deployed via a use of a bucket in the S3 function of AWS and using CloudFront to deply it. First one is about the kind of video games that I like to play. The second one is about the anime I like to watch. Third one is about my favorite genre of movies and which ones I like the most. The last one is about cars and shows videos of the type of cars I like and what I would like to do if I had such car. Each page has a link that will take them back to the homepage that way the user won't have to press the back button or have to resubmit the URL again.

This is the link to the website https://d24syep7fbllnb.cloudfront.net
